						<p>For Self-, I want to evoke a sense of imperfection.  Western culture is obsessed with some form of the unattainable masked as the aspirational, which leads to isolation from ourselves and others.  We remain disconnected, despite the applications and communities that connect us.  For the collective to reenter the present as a self-loving, self-accepting being, it takes effort, discipline, self-awareness, togetherness. It is a difficult path to heal and find time and manage everything we have to manage.  It is difficult to cope and have faith and remain in touch with those we love.  But within ourselves and with each other, I find ferocious hope that we can and will heal.  With deep bonds, in person and hands on activities, with checking in on our friends and family, there is a shining hope that we may see ourselves as whole.  The present is a strange moment; it only feels present if you notice it.  And when you notice it, you notice what’s within it - maybe your back is slumped, maybe your breathing is shallow, maybe your right foot has fallen asleep.  Then, maybe you realize you haven’t called your mom in a while, or forgot to respond to a friend, or thought you drank water but really it’s been five hours since you last hydrated.  Being in the present is a habit we can all form and train and get only better at doing.</p>

						<p>I welcome and encourage any healthy practice that allows you to do that.  If you meditate, pray, practice mindfulness, do yoga, exercise, stretch, take a bath, eat some vegetables, eat some fruit, buy some plants, or even just take one deep breath, being present is a possibility more probable than the valid worries and anxieties that race around your head. We want to become a part of your personal journey to achieve self-acceptance and cultivate togetherness.  We remain here, alongside you, to provide contextual insight into what makes you most present.  We start by simply managing, which is our way of reshaping our relationship to things in life that seem to move us farther from the present, these things being stress, anxiety, and isolation.  You have the power to look at life differently.  Through Self-, you can find your best self. </p>
